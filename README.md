# MotiQ
A set of ImageJ plugins to quantify dynamics, morphology, and fluorescence of microglial (or other) cells.

## Included tools
- **MotiQ_Cropper**: An ImageJ plugin to efficiently select individual cells from single images, time-lapse images, static 3D images, or time-lapse 3D images.
- **MotiQ_Thresholder**: An ImageJ plugin to segment images for later quantification by *MotiQ 2D Analyzer* or *MotiQ 3D Analyzer*.
- **MotiQ_2D_Analyzer**: An ImageJ plugin to quantify the output images from *MotiQ Thresholder* in 2D.
- **MotiQ_3D_Analyzer**: An ImageJ plugin to quantify the output images from *MotiQ Thresholder* in 3D.
